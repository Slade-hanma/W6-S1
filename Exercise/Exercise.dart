// base on the picture, the various cases 
// - when one approach may be better than the other - can be regarded based on the following factors:

// Readability:
// Probably, when a widget creation logic is more complicated, the Dedicated Function approach makes reading a little bit easier.
// When your case is not very complex, it is easier to read and understand, having put the Loop Directly into the List.

// Maintainability:
// - The Dedicated Function approach may render the code more modular and easy to maintain because the widget creation logic is encapsulated in its own function.
// - The other approaches may be more intertwined with the main logic of the function, and it will be harder to maintain when the codebase increases.

// Performance:
// Different approaches may imply different performances - sometimes for use case, sometimes because one or the other has to handle many widgets in creation.
//  The Dedicated Function approach may have a slightly higher overhead due to the function call, but for most use cases this is likely negligible.

// That would imply that the choice between these approaches depends on requirements and complexity of the widget creation logic in a Flutter application. The Dedicated Function approach may become more beneficial in cases where the widget creation logic is more complex; otherwise, other approaches could be more suitable in simpler cases.
